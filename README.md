# ramigs.dev

Website and tech-blog built with Eleventy and Gulp. Deployed and hosted on Netlify.

## TODO

- SEO
- Implement comments engine
https://github.com/philhawksworth/jamstack-comments-engine
- Accessibility: the link texts fail contrast check, I would choose a different way to highlight "JavaScript developer" and "technical writer" as they currently look like links. Also, the yellow on white is not accessible. Check it here: https://contrastchecker.com/
- what if i was a recruiter for a company, who randomly spotted your site somewhere and i wanted to give the other personnel your CV and resume both. where could i easily get your CV, when its not available as a separate file on the site?
-  i would also love to see a portfolio-section on your page, i assume its coming at some point
- Fixed Navbar & change Navbar style on scroll
- Test with Lighthouse Chrome
