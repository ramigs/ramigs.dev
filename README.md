# ramigs.dev

Website and tech-blog built with Eleventy and Gulp. Hosted on Netlify.

## TODO

- Add "TIL" (Today I learned). Idea from @mmatuzo
- Fix mobile navbar links
- Add SVG tech logos
  https://worldvectorlogo.com/search/javascript
- Review responsive behaviour (content size, margins, etc.)
- Add Copy to Clipboard in code snippets
  https://flaviocopes.com/clipboard-api/
- Accessibility: the link texts fail contrast check, I would choose a different way to highlight "JavaScript developer" and "technical writer" as they currently look like links. Also, the yellow on white is not accessible. Check it here: https://contrastchecker.com/
- Navbar/logo style: update on scroll

- Test with Lighthouse Chrome
- Packaging (headline, images; leading image; formatting, platform)
