- Accessibility: the link texts fail contrast check, I would choose a different way to highlight "JavaScript developer" and "technical writer" as they currently look like links. Also, the yellow on white is not accessible. Check it here: https://contrastchecker.com/
- Portfolio section
- Navbar/logo style: update on scroll
