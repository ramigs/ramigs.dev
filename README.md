# ramigs.dev

Website and tech-blog built with Eleventy and Gulp. Deployed and hosted on Netlify.

## TODO

- SEO best-practices: learn and implement
- Add JAMstack comment engine
https://github.com/philhawksworth/jamstack-comments-engine
- Add Copy to Clipboard in code snippets
https://flaviocopes.com/clipboard-api/
- Accessibility: the link texts fail contrast check, I would choose a different way to highlight "JavaScript developer" and "technical writer" as they currently look like links. Also, the yellow on white is not accessible. Check it here: https://contrastchecker.com/
- Portfolio section
- Navbar/logo style: update on scroll
https://growfox.co.uk/
- Test with Lighthouse Chrome
