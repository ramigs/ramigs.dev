# ramigs

Personal website built with Eleventy and Gulp. Deployed and hosted on Netlify.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ramigs/ramigs
cd ramigs
npm
npm install
```

## TODO

- Responsive Navbar: make logo smaller, add margin to nav links
- Accessibility: the link texts fail contrast check, I would choose a different way to highlight "JavaScript developer" and "technical writer" as they currently look like links. Also, the yellow on white is not accessible. Check it here: https://contrastchecker.com/
- you should say where you are located at
- what if i was a recruiter for a company, who randomly spotted your site somewhere and i wanted to give the other personnel your CV and resume both. where could i easily get your CV, when its not available as a separate file on the site?
-  i would also love to see a portfolio-section on your page, i assume its coming at some point
- Add photo in **About Me**
- the yellow "JavaScript developer" and "technical writer" on the landing page aren't linked to anything, while all the other yellow text does link to something. Just caught me off guard as a user a little
- I'd consider spelling out CI/CD like you did with FAsS.
- Also, on your **About page**, maybe remove the non-exhaustive list of things I enjoy and keep the same format where you have the heading followed by the text same as you did with **Who am I** and **Background**
