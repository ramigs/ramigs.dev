<h1>Who am I?</h1>

<div class="profile-img-circle"></div>

<p>
My name is Rami Shashati. I’m a Full Stack Developer from Lisbon who enjoys
building performant, responsive, user-friendly websites and applications, with
the help of modern technology and infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
This website is the platform where I document and keep a reference of some of
the interesting things I learn. I have a wide variety of interests, so expect to
find material and resources covering diverse topics, from JavaScript to CI/CD.
</p>

<p>
Currently, I’m focusing on Node, Vue, and Nuxt.js. I'm also very interested in
build and deploy automation, always with the goal of helping dev teams deliver
better and faster.
</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
I started my career as a Software Engineer in 2010, 
after graduating in <a href="http://lei.di.uminho.pt/">Computer Science</a>, 
at <a href="https://www.uminho.pt">Universidade do Minho</a>, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braga">Braga</a>.
Throughout this time I have been involved in pretty much 
every stage of the development cycle.
I have worked on several projects using HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP and more, 
doing all sorts of things, from requirements to implementation, testing to documentation.
For more details regarding these projects, please take a look at my 
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramigs">resume</a>.
</p>

<p>
During my four year stay with <a href="https://www.fct.pt/">FCT</a>, I've also
done infrastructure administration and technical user support. I was responsible
for managing the different environments, ensuring the required service levels
and the dev team needs were met. I was also involved in the coordination of
deploy and release processes.
</p>

<h2>Things I like</h2>

<p>
I'm particularly interested in serverless, FaaS and microservice architectures.
Lately, I've been mainly using the Jamstack approach, static site generators,
Netlify CMS, and Netlify Functions.
</p>

<p>
In terms of build and deploy, I have experience with gulp, npm, Webpack,
Netlify, and Heroku.
</p>
