<h1>Who am I?</h1>

<div class="profile-img-circle"></div>

<p>
My name is Rami Shashati. I'm an experienced software engineer, specializing in
JavaScript and Vue.js.
</p>

<p>
This website is the platform where I document and keep a reference of some of
the interesting things I learn. I have a wide variety of interests, so you'll
find here resources covering diverse topics, from JavaScript to CI/CD, Vue.js to
Jamstack.
</p>

<p>
I'm particularly interested in Jamstack architectures, serverless, static site
generators, and headless CMSs. Lately, I have been especially focused on Nuxt.js
and Strapi.
</p>

<p>
I embrace complex technical challenges and thrive on implementing objective
solutions. I am always keen to learn, evolve, collaborate, and give my best to
the success of the projects I’m working on.
</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
I started my career in 2010, after completing a post-graduation in​ ​<a
href="http://lei.di.uminho.pt/">Computer Science</a>​, at​ <a
href="https://www.uminho.pt">Universidade do Minho</a>​,​ ​Braga. Throughout
this time I have worked on several projects, taking on different roles, from
requirements to implementation, testing, and documentation.
</p>

<p>
Straight out of university, I’ve worked for two consulting companies. Those
years gave me a lot of practical experience, working in different industries,
clients, projects, and technologies.
</p>

<p>
During my four year stay with​ <a href="https://www.fct.pt/">FCT</a>, I've also
done infrastructure administration and technical user support. I was responsible
for managing the different environments, ensuring services and operations ran as
required. I was also involved in the coordination of deploy and release
processes.
</p>

<p>
Fast forward to 2018, I started doing freelance and consultant work, mostly related to software architecture and web development.
