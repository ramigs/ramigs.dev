<h1>Who am I?</h1>

<p>
My name is Rami Shashati. 
I’m an enthusiastic
developer who enjoys building elegant, responsive, and 
user-friendly websites and applications, with the help 
of modern technology and infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
This website is the platform where I document and keep a reference of
some of the interesting things I learn, with the goal of improving
my teaching and writing skills.
I have a wide variety of interests, so expect to find material and 
resources covering diverse topics, that can go from git to 
Continuous Integration.
</p>

<p>
Currently, I’m working as a freelance developer, using mostly PHP 
and Laravel for the backend
and JavaScript libraries and frameworks for the frontend. 
I also like to implement build 
automation processes, always with the goal of improving 
software dev workflows.
</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

{# The truth is that most developers coming out of college are software generalists: 
they’ve concentrated on maybe one or two languages in their CS classes and toyed 
around with developer tools during hackathons, but otherwise aren’t experts in a 
particular area. While several students end up working for companies they interned at, 
others are left figuring out how to best market themselves to prospective employers. 
In both situations, personal branding plays a key role in guiding one’s career trajectory. #}

<p>
I started my career as a Software Engineer over eight years ago, 
after graduating in <a href="http://lei.di.uminho.pt/">Computer Science</a>, 
at <a href="https://www.uminho.pt">Universidade do Minho</a>, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braga">Braga</a>.
Throughout this time I have been involved in pretty much 
every stage of the development cycle.
I have worked on several projects using HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/Java and more, 
doing all sorts of things, from requirements to implementation, 
testing, and documentation.
For more details regarding these projects, please check my 
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramigs">resume</a>.
</p>

<p>
During my four year stay with <a href="https://www.fct.pt/">FCT</a>, 
I have also started to do infrastructure management, technical user 
support and a bit of DevOps.
I was mainly responsible for maintaining the dev, qa and prod 
environments and helping to ensure that the required service 
levels were met.
I was also involved in managing and coordinating 
production deployment and release processes.
