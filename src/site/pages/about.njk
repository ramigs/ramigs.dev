<h1>About me</h1>

<p>
My name is Rami Shashati. I'm a software engineer with 10+ years experience,
currently focusing on JavaScript/TypeScript, Docker, and DevOps.
</p>

<p>
I help teams and companies build and scale their applications using modern web
technology and tools. For over four years, I have been consulting on software
architecture, development, and process automation.
</p>

<p>
I embrace complex technical challenges and thrive on implementing objective
solutions. I am always keen to learn, evolve, collaborate, and give my best to
the success of the projects Iâ€™m working on.
</p>

<p>
This website is where I host my <a
href="https://ramigs.dev/blog/">tech-blog</a>. I have a wide variety of
interests, so expect to find resources covering topics such as JavaScript,
Linux, Vue.js, and more.
</p>

<h2>Tools & tech</h2>
<p>
The Node.js ecosystem is where I feel the most comfortable at and
from where I usually get the tools that support my day-to-day development work.
</p>

<p>
I'm particularly experienced in frontend development, namely Vue.js/Nuxt.js,
Jamstack, static site generators, headless CMSs, integrating APIs, and
Cypress.js for E2E tests.
</p>

<p>
Lately, I've been enjoying working on DevOps-related tasks, such as containers,
CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions), backup automation, and cloud infrastructure
(DigitalOcean).
