<h1>Who am I?</h1>

<p>
My name is Rami Shashati. 
I’m an enthusiastic and experienced full-stack 
developer who enjoys building elegant, responsive, and 
user-friendly websites and applications, with the help 
of modern technology and infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
This website is the platform where I document and keep a reference of
some of the interesting things I learn, with the goal of improving
my teaching and writing skills.
I have a wide variety of interests, so expect to find material and 
resources covering diverse topics, that can go from git to 
Continuous Integration.
</p>

<p>
Currently, I’m working as a freelance developer, using mostly PHP 
and Laravel for the backend
and JavaScript libraries and frameworks for the frontend. 
I also like to implement build 
automation processes, always with the goal of improving 
software dev workflows.
</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
I started my career as a Software Engineer over eight years ago, 
after graduating in <a href="http://lei.di.uminho.pt/">Computer Science</a>, 
at <a href="https://www.uminho.pt">Universidade do Minho</a>, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braga">Braga</a>.
Throughout this time I have been involved in pretty much 
every stage of the development cycle.
I have worked on several projects using HTML/CSS/JS/PHP/Java and more, 
doing all sorts of things, from requirements to implementation, 
testing, and documentation.
For more details regarding these projects, please check my 
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramigs">resume</a>.
</p>

<p>
During my four year stay with <a href="https://www.fct.pt/">FCT</a>, 
I have also started to do infrastructure management, technical user 
support and a bit of DevOps.
I was mainly responsible for maintaining the dev, qa and prod 
environments and helping to ensure that the required service 
levels were met.
I was also involved in managing and coordinating 
production deployment and release processes.
