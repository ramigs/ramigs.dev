Let's say you're working on a page that has two main components - **Element A**
and **Element B**.

Suppose you had to implement a responsive layout with the following requirements:

1. Desktop: **Element A** should be positioned on top of **Element B**
1. Mobile: **Element B** should be positioned on top of **Element A**

In this tutorial, we'll look at two different approaches to solve these
requirements.

Here's what we'll be setting to achieve:

## Before we begin

It's important to clarify some pre-conditions and set the right expectations as
to what the end result will exactly be.

We assume that both elements are siblings in the DOM - i.e., both are direct
descendants of the same parent element:

```html
<section class="parent">
  <div id="element-a" class="element">
    <h2>HTML Element A</h2>
  </div>
  <div id="element-b" class="element">
    <h2>HTML Element B</h2>
  </div>
</section>
```

We'll look at two different solutions. Both accomplish the requirements
**visually**. However, there are some nuances that can make you decide for one
or the other.

Here are some quick remarks for each solution, so you can jump right away to the
one that better fits your use case.

### Solution 1:

- The parent element is a flex container, or it's not a flex container, but there's no impediment to set it as such
- Achieved using **CSS**
- Does not actually change the DOM order of the elements
- Implemented in less steps
- Breaks keyboard navigation

### Solution 2:

- The parent element is not a flex container, and you can't/don't want to set it as such
- Achieved using **JavaScript**
- Changes the DOM order of the elements
- Implemented in more steps
- Does not break keyboard navigation

## Solution 1: flex-direction

As you may have guessed from the title, we'll be using flexbox. The parent
element has to be a flex container. This is how we make it one:

```css
.parent {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

We've also used `flex-direction` to set the main axis and define how child
elements are placed inside the parent container.

By default, flex items are displayed in the same order as they appear in the
document.

Now, for the mobile layout we want to reverse the order in which the elements
are displayed. The value `column-reverse` does precisely this. Let's go ahead
and add a media query to reverse the `flex-direction` whenever the display area
has a maximum width of 767 pixels:

```css
@media (max-width: 767px) {
  .parent {
    flex-direction: column-reverse;
  }
}
```

And we're done, that's all we need!

If you have more than two child elements and would like to have more control
over their individual display order, checkout the [order
property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Ordering_Flex_Items).

It is important to bear in mind that this solution creates a [disconnect](https://tink.uk/flexbox-the-keyboard-navigation-disconnect/) between
the visual presentation and the DOM order.

## Solution 2: DOM manipulation

We'll be using JavaScript - via [HTML DOM
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_DOM_API) - to access
the document and its elements.

The strategy is to select the element that should be on top - based on the
maximum width of the display area, and insert it as the first child of the
parent element.

First, let's create a variable to represent our media query:

```javascript
const mobile = "(max-width: 767px)";
```

The `Window` interface provides the method `matchMedia()` - which returns a
media query list, matching a specified media query string.

We can then check whether our variable `mobile` matches with the current state
of the document.

So letâ€™s define a function that conditionally sets **Element A** or **Element
B** as first child of the parent element:

```javascript
function setFirstChild() {
  const matched = window.matchMedia(mobile).matches;

  const topElement = matched
    ? document.getElementById("element-b")
    : document.getElementById("element-a");

  const parent = topElement.parentNode;
  parent.insertBefore(topElement, parent.firstChild);
}
```

Notice that there was no need to explicitly remove it from the DOM, store it in
a temporary variable, and append it again.

Since it already exists in the document, `insertBefore()` moves it from its
current position to the new position.

Now, we attach the function we've just created to the load event, so it runs
when the document is loaded:

```javascript
window.onload = setFirstChild;
```

Finally, we need to watch for media query changes, so that if the user resizes
the browser the order updates accordingly:

```javascript
window.matchMedia(mobile).addEventListener("change", setFirstChild);
```

You can now test that everything is working as expected by reloading and
resizing the browser.

## Wrapping up

We've seen two ways to dynamically change the order of HTML elements based on
the display width. Neither is necessarily _better_.

Solution 1 is arguably more practical. However, it breaks keyboard navigation.

Solution 2 manipulates the DOM, which is operationally more intensive than using
media queries.

You can reference the code I used to create this tutorial, which includes
examples for both solutions.
