TIL that it's possible in git to directly move unstaged changes and switch to a
new branch, using command `git switch -c new-branch`.

Very useful when one forgets to create a new branch and starts to do some work
on the mainline branch.

Found on this [CSS-Tricks
article](https://css-tricks.com/git-switching-unstaged-changes-to-a-new-branch/).
