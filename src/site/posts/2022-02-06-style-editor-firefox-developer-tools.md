TIL about the [Style
Editor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Style_Editor) in [Firefox
Developer Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools) and how useful
it can be to quickly view and edit all the stylesheets associated with a page.
It allows also to create/import new ones and apply them to the page.

It can be specially helpful in situations where one is not able to run a project
locally and only needs to work on the CSS, or when the project does not have Hot
Module Replacement.
