TIL about this [VScode extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh).

It allows accessing and editing folder and files on any remote environment over
SSH.

Even though this is a great productivity tool to have in my toolkit, it should
not stop me for learning more in-depth either `nano` or `vim` ðŸ¤“.
