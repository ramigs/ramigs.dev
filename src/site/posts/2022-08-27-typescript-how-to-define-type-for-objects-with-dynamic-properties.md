TIL how to define a type for objects with dynamic properties. By this we mean an
object that can have any number of properties, with unknown property names and
values. However, we know what their **types** should be.

Let's take a look at an example to make this clearer.

Let's say we want to create a type to represent dictionary objects such as:

```js
const dictionary = {
  hello: "ol√°",
  goodbye: "adeus",
};
```

In this case, we want Typescript to help us enforce that both property name and
property value are of type `string`.

We can use the `Record` utility type, like so:

```js
type MyDictionary = Record<string, string>;

const dictionary: MyDictionary = {};
```

Now, if we try to set something like the following, Typescript will signal an
error and stop us:

```js
// Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
dictionary.one = 1;
```

This utility type is a name alias for [index
signatures](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html#index-signatures):

```js
type MyDictionary = { [k: string]: string };
```
