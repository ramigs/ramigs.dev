Came across the recent blog post [A (more) Modern CSS
Reset](https://andy-bell.co.uk/a-more-modern-css-reset/) by [Andy
Bell](https://andy-bell.co.uk/).

It includes a set of CSS rules with sensible declarations for reducing browser
inconsistencies.

Really like that it's quite comprehensive (without being huge), as well as the
author's breakdown of each rule. Will consider using it (at least as a starting)
in my future projects.
