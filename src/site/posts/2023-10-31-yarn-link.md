TIL about `yarn link`.

Very useful for local development. The
[documentation](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/link/) says it
best:

> "For development, a package can be linked into another project. This is often
> useful to test out new features or when trying to debug an issue in a package
> that manifests itself in another project."

When you're done, don't forget to run `yarn unlink` on the _child_ package (to
remove all symlinks) and `yarn install --force` on the _parent_ project (to
force the re-installation of dependencies and use the package from the project's
`node_modules` folder again).
