Mystery solved! I finally discovered why sometimes I'd notice inconsistencies in
terms of the TypeScript errors between the terminal and VSCode.

This happened because I was using different TypeScript versions. By default,
VSCode uses its own TypeScript version (typically a more recent version than the
one used by the project).

I'd expect that the default would be for VSCode to use the project's version,
but it seems it doesn't.

I suggest always having VSCode use the project's version. This can be achieved
by [setting VSCode to use the TypeScript Workspace
Version](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/52396#issuecomment-1404056467).

This will add `"typescript.tsdk": "node_modules/typescript/lib"` to
`.vscode/settings.json` and should be committed to the repository, so that the
entire team can benefit from it.

You can also add the setting to your own VSCode **User Settings**, so that this
applies to any instance of VSCode you open:

```yaml
"typescript.tsdk": "node_modules\\typescript\\lib",
"typescript.enablePromptUseWorkspaceTsdk": true,
```

Now the project is in charge (not the editor), no more confusing differences ðŸ™Œ.

**Note:** Don't forget to check with your team before pushing the `.vscode`
folder to the repository, because if someone is already using a
`.vscode/settings.json` file locally, this will cause conflicts. Unfortunately,
at the moment of writing, it's still not possible to [extend
settings](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/15909). Alternatively, you
can push a `.vscode/settings.json.default` to serve as reference, similar to
what it's done with `env.default` or `env.sample`, for example.
