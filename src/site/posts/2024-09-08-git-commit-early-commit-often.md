Yesterday I got reminded of this the hard way, by loosing a reasonable amount of
work due to an accidental `git restore .` in my command history.

My IDE was closed at that time, so wasn't even able to use its undo
functionality to recover my changes.

Just another gentle reminder to "commit early, commit often".
