Just another gentle reminder to "commit early, commit often".

Yesterday I got reminded of this the hard way, when loosing a reasonable amount
of work due to an accidental `git restore .`.

My IDE was closed at that time, so wasn't even able to use its undo
functionality to recover my changes ðŸ˜­.
