In this article, I want to reflect and share my experience on working with
[Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/), pretty much on a daily basis, in a continuous
delivery production project/setting, over the past three months.

Hopefully, I'll also be able to reignite my writing habit back on track, as I've
haven't had much opportunity to do so lately. been pretty much fully focused on

Now that the project is approaching the finish line, It's time to reflect on
this period and the massive evolution. collect and review my thoughts

This won't be a Nuxt.js tutorial. There are lot of awesome resources around. I‚Äôm
not going to review it in depths, I just want to focus on my experience using
the framework and some cool plugins I've discovered along the way. "I will be
basing my review and experiences on my opinions, or specifically on how I felt
Gatsby performed when applied to my particular use case"

## What led me to Nuxt.js

In December 2019, I landed in a project where I was responsible for choosing the
tech-stack for frontend with extremely tight deadlines.

Luckily, by the same time, I started to participate in a project at the awesome
[freecodecamp Lisbon](https://freecodecamplisbon.org/) community, where I was
introduced to Nuxt.js. It couldn't have come at a better time.

So I started to go through some tutorials, and was impressed As I didn't have a
lot time, I had to make a decision.

I have to admit I was a bit apprehensive to see how it handled a real project to
fully explore how it handles the complexity.

The project is now getting close to being finished, so this is a good time to
pause and see how the experience has been.

## Project Requirements

Although I can't share too specific details about the project, I'll try to give
an overview of the scope and top level requirements.

SEO requirements

At this point, it started to become clear that we needed a SSR approach.

and Nuxt
seemed to be the clear winner. There was 2.0.0 major release and good
documentation, and we decided to take a risk with a new technology on a new
project. And so we took Nuxt as a framework for."

## What is Nuxt.js? Quick Overview

Coined as "The Progressive Vue.js Framework", Nuxt.js is a free and open source
web application framework based on Vue.js.

Some of Nuxt.js's main features:

- Automatic transpilation and bundling
- Hot module replacement
- Server-side rendering OR Single Page App OR Static Generated, you choose üî•
- Static file serving
- Configurable with a nuxt.config.js file
- Custom layouts with the layouts/ directory
- Middleware
- Code splitting for every pages

Nuxt.js benefits:

Disponibilizam tamb√©m funcionalidades para SEO, bem como middlewares para
facilitar o acesso aos dados.

As vantagem √© que este tipo de frameworks oferecem j√° uma estrutura definida,
bem como um build pipeline, em que facilmente podemos integrar tarefas de build
adicionais (bundle dos assets ou PostCSS, por exemplo)

### Understanding Server-Side Rendering

"Applications rendered on the server side are SEO-friendly by default.
Server-side rendering (SSR) is faster because it doesn‚Äôt wait for the browser to
load the JS to show content. SSR requires proper servers to send the response
every time"

- performance / automatic code splitting (pre-rendered pages)

Powerful Routing System with Asynchronous Data

infamous `asyncData`

If you need better inital rendering on first load or SEO then Nuxt is for you.
If you don‚Äôt need to worry about SEO and your app is light, then Vue Cli will
work perfectly.

"Nuxt is the best framework I've ever used! Been using it for almost 2 years and
can't imagine production level Vue application without Nuxt anymore"

opinated framework Nuxt has its own set of conventions and caveats so it‚Äôs not
Vue Cli vs Nuxt, but more about choosing which one will best suit your
requirements.

### Vue CLI vs. Nuxt.js

" that the client and server are two separate entities." understanding the
lifecycle and how do i access window global object's property from vue
component?? ", you will have the mental overhead of constantly having to
consider both"

- SSR/universal mode SEO; Vue.js apps are not suited for SEO (main advantadge!)

"The point of Nuxt is that you can render your Vue code before the user sees it,
whether that's on the server or simply prerendering a static site. Then, you can
still keep all of the interactive nature of Vue, because it "hydrates" the app
once it's loaded.

There are two main benefits in using this, from what I can see:

1. **SEO**. If you're prerendering or SSR your code, search engines can more
   effectively crawl the content. If you're spinning up a straight Vue app with the
   CLI, this is a lot more difficult, especially if you're AJAX-ing in content
   after page load.
2. **Performance**. If you're prerendering or SSR your code, the browser doesn't
   have to do it, and so there's at least a perceived performance gain here."

"A poorly-coded SPA can easily eat up megabytes or even gigabytes of memory"

> care with the resources on the user‚Äôs device." - _[Nolan
> Lawson](https://nolanlawson.com/2020/02/19/fixing-memory-leaks-in-web-applications/)_

"The way I see it, is more like Nuxt.js higher level framework. Indeed, you can
build anything with Nuxt that you can build with Vue CLI, but it also adds SSR
features on top of it."

### Developer Experience

"Setting up a new project is easy and straightforward: Nuxt.js has an official
scaffolding tool (`create-nuxt-app`) that walks you through some options
(such as server-side and UI framework, linting, code formatting) and setups your
project, so you can quickly start developing your application.

"everything has its place"

- no need for complicated Vue Router setup and configuration, just placing files
  and folders
- `nuxt.config.js` file, the central point of Nuxt.js app. "There is also a
  nuxt.config.js file at the project root. This allows you to customize a bunch
  of features that Nuxt provides. By default, it sets the header tags, loading
  bar color, and ESLint rules for you. If you‚Äôre eager to see what you can
  configure, here‚Äôs the documentation; we will be covering some options in this
  article."

Cons:

"Your lib is available only for client side"

I faced some difficulties DOM tree "Errors were a bit tricky to debug." nuxt is
great but some vue plugins don't compatible with nuxt,
"Mismatching childNodes vs. VNodes"
Failed to execute 'appendChild' on 'Node': This node type does not support this method.
The client-side rendered virtual DOM tree is not matching
server-rendered content. This is likely caused by incorrect HTML markup, for
example nesting block-level elements inside <p>, or missing <tbody>. Bailing
hydration and performing full client-side render.

## Was it worth it? Verdict

Yes, absolutely!

I think Nuxt.js is an awesome, production-ready tool üëç for modern web development.
If your application requires SSR, you can't go wrong with Nuxt.

"I personally prefer Nuxt as it simplifies the process of project bootstrapping,
gives sane defaults and less material to deal with build process. If a project
requires SSR, I would definitely suggest you to go with Nuxt."

What would I've done different if I started the project again?

For example having the possibility of some pages being statically generated and
others SSR.

"Well, this pretty much summarizes my first steps in the Nuxt.js ecosystem.

" I learned a lot in the process of building the magazine. I‚Äôve been challenged
to come up with techniques I‚Äôd never come up with before, as well as use and
modify existing ones that I also thought I‚Äôd never have to use.

I will be writing a series of short articles about some of the techniques I used
instead of a long case study here, because otherwise it would literally be way
too long for anyone to read. You'll be able to find the articles on the blog."
